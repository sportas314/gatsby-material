### GETTING AWAY FROM IT ALL
<div style="text-align: justify">

*Animal Crossing: New Horizons* begins the same way as the four previous games in the core series: 
a childlike human finds themself in the middle of the wilderness. 
Suddenly, a raccoon appears from the shadows with a proposition.

“*Come live here!*” he says. The child agrees. It seems nice, after all. But suddenly, the child is 
saddled with the debt of their first house, and must sell bugs and fish to settle up.

New Horizons doesn’t deviate from the core gameplay of Animal Crossing much at all. It’s a low-pressure 
life simulator where you’re free to fill the days however you like. If you’d prefer to plant trees and 
make a forested wonderland, you can do that. If you’d rather focus on gathering critters to donate to the 
local museum, developing an extensive arrangement of living exhibits, that’s also an option. Or maybe you 
just want to make your house as pretty as possible, filling it with matching furniture and wallpaper?

There’s satisfaction in finding a new, rare fish you’ve never caught before, or saying hi to a neighbor, 
only to receive the perfect birdbath as a housewarming present. It’s about living in a world where the 
biggest concern is whether your apples are going to be ready for picking today or tomorrow. It’s about 
finding a new home.

The shift in New Horizons is that this all takes place on a tropical island instead of in a nondescript 
wilderness. The setting doesn’t have a major impact on the story or gameplay, but tonally, it does add 
an air of chill to the whole thing.

Tom Nook, the famous raccoon/oligarch, starts off your visit to his island with a luau, complete with 
fruit cocktails in front of a roaring bonfire. Random animal villagers talk about how they needed a 
break from the world and came here for some peace and quiet. Which ... like, fair.

New Horizons offers a much higher level of detail on even the smallest of critters. It helps the island 
feel alive. Each creepy centipede leg is visible the moment it pops out from beneath a rock, for better 
or worse.

Bits of furniture have always had some level of interactivity to them, but now you can clearly make out 
the hands of a clock as it ticks away, or the record player as it spins the latest K.K. Slider jam. Even 
though these visual details are purely aesthetic, they all combine to make the environment feel bustling 
and vibrant.

## THE KING OF THE ISLAND

Despite the jump in visual fidelity, the heart of Animal Crossing hasn’t changed. New Horizons is still 
about waking up each day, making friends with local animal characters, laying out furniture in your home, 
and donating dinosaur fossils to the nearby museum.

While this is all presented as an experience with no clear objective and a “do-what-you-feel” vibe, there 
is a main goal in New Horizons: to make the best damn island possible. It’s in this implicit challenge that 
this installment goes above and beyond what past games have offered, letting you create a truly customized 
habitat for you and your animal friends.

New Horizons makes enormous changes to the island construction process, putting you in complete control over 
every major decision. You can decide the location of the housing plot for every new villager, before they even 
move in. You choose where the museum and the shop will be built and if you don’t like where you've placed your 
house initially, you can move it for a modest fee.

Forcing new villagers into perfect, Manhattan-esque grids is somewhat tonally inconsistent with the happy-go-lucky 
nature of Animal Crossing, but how much you obsess about this stuff is really up to you. 

The level of control is thrilling, and that’s even before unlocking the much-vaunted “terraforming” feature, a 
late-game addition that lets you carve out rivers, roads, and cliffs to sculpt the island however you want it. It 
may take a few weeks, but eventually every New Horizons village will be a true representation of the player who created it.

Animal Crossing: New Horizons is a respite from the current state of the world.
