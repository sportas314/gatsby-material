# IT IS POST-POST-POST-APOCALYPSE

<div style="text-align: justify">

Horizon Zero Dawn is a post-apocalyptic game, but not of the variety we've seen lots of in games like Fallout 4 and The Last of Us. 
It is post-post-post-apocalypse: hundreds if not thousands of years after whatever catastrophe befell society. In this strange, barely 
familiar world, the massive skyscrapers and technology of our modern civilization have been abandoned. What humans remain form tribes, 
hunting with bows and spears and living a life shaped around an earth-based, shamanistic religion.

These human tribes also have to contend with another force for survival: the machines, giant robots that resemble dinosaurs and other 
animals. These terrifying opponents were left behind by the Ancient Ones, before the old world ended, and little is known about them 
other than that they're equipped with weaponry and power that humans of the new world simply can't compete with.

It's in this vision of the future that players take control of Aloy, a talented young huntress cast out from her tribe and desperately 
seeking answers about where she came from. Though she is in many ways the traditional video game protagonist — brisk in speech, unstoppable 
in power, ready and willing to go along with whatever quest she is given — she provides a perfect pair of curious eyes to slowly reveal the 
mysteries of this world.

Those mysteries are a driving force in Horizon Zero Dawn, so I'll only say that the game surprises numerous ways. It's darker than 
expected in its imagining of what ended civilization, but it's also more hopeful regarding humanity's chances at continued existence. 
Aloy herself is largely a tool accomplishing the needs of the game, but Horizon's cast of characters was strong enough to earn the audience
investment.

That cast includes characters like the drunken warrior Erend, the new-to-the-throne and progressive-minded Sun King Avad and the mysterious, 
omniscient Sylens. It's a cast whose progress through the story I was eager to witness, and the political maneuvering of the world of Horizon 
weaves myriad opportunities for intrigue both in this game and the future. Horizon Zero Dawn answers the vast majority of the questions it presents. 
It leaves characters with arcs that feel completed but also a bear sense of continuity, of possible direction for the future. It builds in the 
potential for sequels and spinoffs, but in a smart, natural way, without the need for frustrating cliffhangers or unresolved plot threads.

Aloy herself may not be an incredibly deep character, but she grounds Horizon's gameplay via a wide array of combat abilities that grows as 
the game progresses. Through both crafting new weapons and items and learning new skills via leveling up, Aloy grows from an above-average hunter 
to a woman revered across the land as an unstoppable machine killer. While she's up against technological nightmares, Aloy embraces technology 
in a way other members of her tribe do not.

Early in her life, she discovers a strange item called a "focus" that allows her to scan the environment and see trails left by people. Aloy 
uses the focus quite a bit in quests and story moments, but it's also a key to combat. The focus allows you to see the weak points on your robot 
enemies, which means even if you're using a bow and arrow or slingshot against them, you can target the exact points that will do the most damage.

Fighting the machines in Horizon Zero Dawn — especially the larger ones — is a thrilling, exhausting experience, one that improves over time as Aloy 
buys and crafts more tools, opening up more options to take the beasts down. 

Horizon encourages you to use the widest possible variety of options at your disposal. The bigger the robot, the more of a struggle the fight is. 
Aloy's tasks aren't difficult, exactly. Rather, larger robots just have a lot of health, and they're big and imposing, and they can take out a good chunk 
of your health bar with one stomp or laser blast. You need to approach fights prepared, with a backpack full of resources so you can craft more ammo or 
potions on the fly.

## HORIZON ZERO DAWN FEELS LIKE A STORIED DEVELOPER FINALLY FINDING ITS VOICE
Horizon Zero Dawn thrums with the energy of a creative team finally allowed to explore something new. It builds on elements of open-world and loot-and-craft gameplay that we've seen before, but it does so within a context, a setting and a style that feel fresh. Horizon Zero Dawn discovers a stronger sense of its own personality in one game than Killzone ever managed across half a dozen. Guerrilla Games has long been developing some of the most buzzed-about games in the industry; with Horizon, it feels like it has finally found its own voice, one worthy of all that buzz.
